		<div class="col-xl-3 border-danger text-dark">1. <b>Return for your belongings</b><br><center><img src="https://www.gastrikeraddningstjanst.se/globalassets/dokument/in-english/confine-the-fire-1.jpg" height="250" width="300" class="rounded"></center></div>
		<div class="col-xl-9 border-danger text-dark">Everyone was told in school at one point or another that they should leave all of their stuff and get out when there is a fire, and it is absolutely true. You may think that you have time to grab a few things, but it can take just 5 minutes for a house to become engulfed in flames.<br><br>Items are replaceable and nothing is worth more than your life, so your priority should always be getting out as quickly as possible.</div>
		<div class="col-xl-3 border-danger text-dark">2. <b>Hide</b><br><center><img src="https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/b/b4/Escape-from-a-Fire-Step-5-Version-2.jpg/aid129578-v4-728px-Escape-from-a-Fire-Step-5-Version-2.jpg" height="230" width="280" class="rounded"></center></div>
		<div class="col-xl-9 border-danger text-dark">When you’re scared and panicking, you might not know what to do and hide away from the fire for some semblance of safety, but that can be incredibly dangerous. It limits movement and makes it harder for you to be found when rescue services arrive.<br><br>Furthermore, you may think you’re safe from the fire if you can’t see it, but the smoke and heat can be even more dangerous and can reach you wherever you are. Ready reports that fires can reach up to 100 degrees at floor level and 600 degrees at eye level, which can result in severe lung burns.</div>
		<div class="col-xl-3 border-danger text-dark">3. <b>Use Lifts/Elevators</b><br><center><img src="https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/3/35/Ride-an-Elevator-Step-4-Version-2.jpg/v4-460px-Ride-an-Elevator-Step-4-Version-2.jpg.webp" height="230" width="280" class="rounded"></center></div>
		<div class="col-xl-9 border-danger text-dark">It might be tempting to take the lift during a fire because it seems to be the quicker option in escaping, but in reality, it can actually end up being much more dangerous. Fire damage could short-circuit the lift at any time, meaning the doors could open at any time. Or, if power is lost, you could end up stuck in the lift.<br><br>The lift shaft also acts as a natural chimney and fills with smoke, which means that the lift itself can very quickly fill with smoke as well and anyone inside would choke. Stairs are always the better, safer option.</div>
		<div class="col-xl-3 border-danger text-dark">4. <b>Open Hot Doors</b><br><center><img src="https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/6/6f/Decide-Whether-It-Is-Safe-to-Escape-During-a-Fire-Step-8.jpg/v4-460px-Decide-Whether-It-Is-Safe-to-Escape-During-a-Fire-Step-8.jpg.webp" height="230" width="280" class="rounded"></center></div>
		<div class="col-xl-9 border-danger text-dark">When attempting to find a way to escape a fire, you might not be considering what could be on the other side of the doors you come across, which is why you should always try to be cautious.<br><br>Doors that are very hot to the touch or have smoke billowing through the cracks will more than likely have a fire on the other side. This means that the door is actually holding the fire back and opening it would only allow the fire to spread. If you find a door that you believe to be safe, open it, but always do so cautiously, with the awareness that it could be dangerous on the other side.</div>
		<div class="col-xl-3 border-danger text-dark">5. <b>Break Windows</b><br><center><img src="https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/c/c7/Fix-a-Broken-Window-in-a-Wooden-Frame-Step-1-Version-2.jpg/aid89415-v4-728px-Fix-a-Broken-Window-in-a-Wooden-Frame-Step-1-Version-2.jpg.webp" height="230" width="280" class="rounded"></center></div>
		<div class="col-xl-9 border-danger text-dark">The majority of deaths related to fires are actually caused by smoke inhalation rather than the heat of the fire itself, in fact Michigan State University reported that 50% of people who suffer from severe smoke inhalation die. Knowing this, it can be tempting to break open windows to allow the smoke to billow out of the building, but this is the wrong thing to do.<br><br>Breaking open windows allows the fire to gain more access to oxygen which helps the fire grow, which would greatly decrease your chances of escape. By keeping the windows closed you are starving the fire as much as possible.<br><br>It is much better to use the precious moments you have when a fire occurs to find an escape route.</div>
